# Retail-Sales-Forecasting-for-the-U.S.-Used-Car-Market
This research forecasts U.S. used car retail sales from January 2018 to December 2019 using time-series data from 1992 to 2017. It applies four forecasting methods: Exponential Smoothing, Multiplicative and Additive Decomposition Models, and ARIMA. Models are evaluated using MAPE to determine the most accurate prediction technique.

* **Overview**:
This research focuses on forecasting retail sales of used cars in the United States utilizing time-series data collected from used car dealerships. The dataset comprises monthly sales data, measured in millions of dollars, covering January 1992 to December 2017. The goal is to utilize multiple forecasting methodologies to predict sales for the period spanning January 2018 to December 2019. The selected forecasting techniques, within our curriculum, are as follows:
a. Exponential Smoothing
b. Decomposition Method – Multiplicative Model
c. Decomposition Method – Additive Model
d. ARIMA – Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
The evaluation and comparison of these forecasting models will rely on the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) to ascertain the superior predictive accuracy among the models. This study aims to provide important insights into the optimal forecasting methodology for retail sales of pre-owned cars in the United States. Trying to present a thorough analysis of selected methods and their individual performances, contributes valuable findings to this research.

A.) **Exponential Smoothing**
Utilizing the exponential smoothing forecasting technique, we tested 12 distinct models involving four trends: No Trend, Linear, Damped, and Exponential, and three seasonal levels:
No Seasonality, Additive, and Multiplicative. Through out-of-sample evaluation, we computed the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) for these models. Among them, the model having Exponential Trend and Multiplicative Seasonality exhibited the lowest MAPE, recorded at 2.77.
